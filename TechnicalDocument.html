                    What is Python?<br>   
                    Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
                    It is used for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>web development (server-side)</li>
                        <li>software development</li>
                        <li>mathematics</li>
                        <li>system scripting</li>

                    Python Syntax compared to other programming languages<br>
                    <li>Python was designed to for readability, and has some 
                        similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
                    </li>
                    <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming
                        languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.

                        the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs<br>
                        Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a 
                        variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.<br>
                    <code>
                                message = "Hello Python world!"
                                print(message)
                                outPut is: Hello Python world!
                    </code>

                        <h4>what is a list?</h4><br>
                        list is a collection of items in a particular order. 
                        You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet,<br>
                         the digits from 0–9, or the names of all the people in your family. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements <br>
                        in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that
                        contains a few kinds of houses:<br>
                    <code>
                        houses = ["bangalow", "hut", "unipot", "flat"]<br>
                        print(houses)

                        #If you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its
                         representation of the list, including the square brackets:

                        ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'] 
                    </code>

                </header>
                    <p>
                        Python is an object oriented programming language.Almost everything in Python <br>
                        is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor,
                        or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
                    <h4>Creating a Class</h4>
                    To create a class, use the keyword class: forexample:
                    <code>
                        class Person():
                        def __init__(self, name, age):
                        #these are method attributes.
                            self.name = name
                            self.age = age
                        #these are the class activities
                        def profile(self):
                            print("hello welcome to Python dear:" + self.name )
                            print("you are now:", self.age ,"years dear")
                        #object instantiation.
                        student = Person("Nakayiza", 45)
                        #calling a method in the class Shamm
                        print(student.profile())
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        the __init__() Method
                        A function that’s part of a class is a method.
                        Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well;<br>
                        The __init__() method is a special method Python runs automatically 
                        whenever we create a new instance based on the class<br>
                        The self parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come 
                        first before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition<br> because 
                        when Python calls this __init__() method later,  the method call will automatically
                        pass the self argument.

                    <h4>definition of a function</h4>
                </header>
                    <p>
                        A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a <br>
                        single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application<br>
                         and a high degree of code reusing.
                    <h4>Syntax</h4>
                    <code>
                         def printme( str ):
                         "This prints a passed string into this function"
                         print str
                         return
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Calling a function</h4>
                        Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies 
                        the parameters that are to be included in the function and <br>
                        structures the blocks of code.Once the basic structure of a function is finalized,
                        you can execute it by calling it from another function or<br> directly from the Python prompt.
                        Following is the example to call printme() function −
                    <code>
                        # Function definition is here
                        def printme( str ):
                        "This prints a passed string into this function"
                        print str
                        return;
                        # Now you can call printme function
                        printme("I'm first call to user defined function!")
                        printme("Again second call to the same function")
                    </code>
                    When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
                    <code>
                        I'm first call to user defined function!
                        Again second call to the same function
                    </code>
                    </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="loops">

                    <h1>
                        Python while Loops and user inputs.
                        <h4>user inputs</h4>
                        <h5>how the user input works</h5>
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter 
                        some text. Once Python receives the user’s input, it stores it in a variable<br>
                        to make it convenient for you to work with. For example, the following program
                        asks the user to enter some text, then displays that message back to the user:
                    <code>
                        message = input("enter your name: ") 
                        print(message)
                    </code>
                        The input() function takes one argument: the prompt, or instructions, that we want 
                        to display to the user so they know what to do. In this example, when Python runs the<br> 
                        first line, the user sees the prompt Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: . 
                        The program waits while the user enters their response and continues after the user presses enter.<br>
                        The response is stored in the variable message, then print(message) displays the input back to the user:
                    <code>
                        enter your name: Nakayiza Shamim 
                        Nakayiza Shamim 
                    </code>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>while Loops</h4> 
                        You can use a while loop to count up through a series of numbers. <br>
                        For example, the following while loop counts from 1 to 5:
                    <code>
                        current_number = 1 
                        while current_number <= 5:    
                        print(current_number)    
                        current_number += 1
                    </code>
                        In the first line, we start counting from 1 by setting the value of current_number to 1.<br>
                        The while loop is then set to keep running as long as the value of current_number is less than or equal to 5.<br>
                        The code inside the loop prints the value of current_number and then adds 1 to that value with current_number += 1.<br>
                        (The += operator is shorthand for current_number = current_number + 1.) 
                    <code>
                        outPut of the code above:
                        1
                        2
                        3
                        4
                        5
                    </code>
